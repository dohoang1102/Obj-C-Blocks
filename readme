QPBlockKeepers can be assigned a block and a dictionary of parameters then have that block run with their parameters or a new dictionary of parameters.

The parameterizedBlock is the paramBlock property.
It is a typedef void (^BlockKeeperBlock)(NSDictionary *d);

The block keeper has an executionParams property which is a dictionary to be used with the parameterizedBlock.

You can set executionParams on a QPBlockKeeper and then run its paramBlock with the executionParams by calling 

[bk executeWithDefaultParams];

You can also pass in your own parameters with
NSDictionary *d = [NSDictionary dictionary];
[bk executeWithParameters:params];
